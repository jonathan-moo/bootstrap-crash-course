# Bootstrap Crash Course By [Jonathan Moo](https://levelupwithdata.com)
## Introduction
Purpose of this repo is to give students a template of how they can use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), a frontend toolkit, to help with their content management and story-telling of data.

## Prerequisites
* You need a basic understanding of how HTML, CSS and Javascript works.
* You need an understanding of how relative paths and folder directories work.

## Examples
There are two examples within this repo as shown with the folder structure:
```
.
├── bootstrap-cdn                   # Including Bootstrap via publicly hosted CDNs
│   └── assets                      # Publicly accessible assets
│       ├── css                     # For CSS customization
│       └── js                      # For JavaScript customization
├── bootstrap-local                 # Downloading and using Bootstrap toolkit locally
│   └── assets                      # Publicly accessible assets

│       │   └── js                      # Bootstrap's JS files

* For ease of use, refer to the `bootstrap-cdn` folder as an example.
* If you want to explore more in terms of hosting the files for professional use, then consider the `bootstrap-local` folder.

Open your default web browser to access the `index.html` files in both folders.
